# Waterfall - Bugs and Feature Requests

Welcome! This GitHub repo is intended to serve as an easy way to see known bugs and report new ones. In addition, you can request new features here. 

## Conduct
There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is a pretty relaxed environment, please remember the following:

*  Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
*  Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
*  DO NOT USE ALL CAPS WHEN CREATING A BUG REPORT.
*  Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists. Remember: we're a small team, so if your issue isn't resolved immediately, it doesn't mean that a fix is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated!

## Bugs

If you encounter a bug on Waterfall, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/WaterfallCollective/WaterfallBugsFeatures/issues) to see if someone has reported it. Include closed issues in your search. 

If it has been reported - give it a thumbs up so we know how many people are experiencing it and help us prioritise. If you have extra info to add, please do! 

If it's not been reported - congratulations! You found a new bug (maybe)! Create a new issue, using the template. Give as much information as possible to help us track it down. 

We'll need at least the following:

* Device
* Browser
* A short descriptive title
* A detailed description of the issue
* Steps for reproducing it, if possible

## Feature Requests

If you're asking for a new feature, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/WaterfallCollective/WaterfallBugsFeatures/issues) to see if someone has already asked. Include closed issues in your search. 

If it has been asked for - go ahead and put your two cents in for the existing entry. 

If not, follow the template! Giving a detailed reasoning is always appreciated - if it's something we've not agreed with before, you might be able to sway us if you can point out something we hadn't considered. 

Remember though - just because a feature has been asked for, doesn't mean we'll get to it. Sometimes something just doesn't fit what we're going for, and bugs will always take priority over feature requests. That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here. Be clear. Be concise.
